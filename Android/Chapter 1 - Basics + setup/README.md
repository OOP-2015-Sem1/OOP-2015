# Chapter 1 - Basics + setup

## Objective
Set everything up and get the basics of Android development.

## Deadline
Third OOP Lab (week 3 of school year) 

## Important notes:
- Before everything, download and install [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/#!/download) and make sure that you will run every application on a virtual machine created in Genymotion. You can find a simple installing and usage guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU75HgTwtJY)
- Do not use Eclipse for Android development! Always prefer Android Studio (as you'll see in the tutorials)
- Research your own reading/viewing material. [Learn 2 Google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Googling+is+easy.+See%3F).

## Video list
1. Mandatory: first 20 videos from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAbQgLGKd3Y&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBsvRxJJOzG4r4k_zLKrnxl)
2. Also useful for starters are the first 4 of [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObYbdoVV7Hg) 
3. Investigate the Activity Lifecycle from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h69WDWZdqi4) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooWKZgJnYVo) 

## Reading list
For now, visual aid is better than reading anything. I will maybe post reading material for later chapters.
